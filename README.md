# CogniCalc


### This project aims to build a calculator that does the usual basic operations (+,-,*,/) by training an machine learning model with an transformer architecture.

## State of the project:
##### Right now i am trying just to make it sum 2 numbers
##### I have build all the transformer model, a customize tokenizer and a self-build dataloader that just creates random a+b problems. I have decided to use a encoder-decoder transformer because I related the problem more with a translation problem(which works with encoder-decoder) than with an text-generator problem(that just uses an decoder)

## Progress achieved:
##### I have been working on this project on my own for some time and I don't get better results than random, or if i do is because of overfitting, i am kind of new on machine learning and I really don't see how i can improve results, every suggestion is well received, thanks.

## Use it:
##### For trying the code by your own you just need to clone the repository on your local machine, start your enviroment and download the requirements.txt then you should be able to run train.py :)
